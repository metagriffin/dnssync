* add support for --version
* move driver support to use asset's plugin mechanism
* TTL-change only record changes seem to not take effect...
* during download, if config file was used, inject "dnssync-config" local variable
* during upload, in-place update the SOA serial...
* make it so that a zonefile can be "verified" without all the
  stuff currently being required in `dnssync-config`...
